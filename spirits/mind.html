    The mind always seemed like an individual. Your soul is one thing and your mind is something else.
    You can talk to it, you can negotiate with it, but you can't grasp it. The only way to master it
    is by adding habits to it, so be careful of what habits you choose. And be careful of unaware 
    minds.
